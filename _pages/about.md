Hello!
======
I am a researcher and data enthusiast broadly focused on data-driven stochastic optimization algorithms. Also, I started to contribute an an open source developer in different projects from 2018. Visit [Open projects](/projects/) for more details.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate associated with the [Optimization and Decision Systems group](https://www.rug.nl/research/enteg/optimization-and-decision-systems/) in [Engineering and Technology Institute Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/research/enteg/?lang=en) at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/). Prior to this, I received a Bachelor of Technology in 2014 and a Masters of Science in 2017, both in Electrical Engineering, from the [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en).
